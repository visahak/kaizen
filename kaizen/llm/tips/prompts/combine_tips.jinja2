You are consolidating multiple AI agent guidelines that were generated from similar tasks.

# Task Descriptions
These guidelines came from tasks like:
{% for desc in task_descriptions %}
- {{ desc }}
{% endfor %}

# Existing Guidelines
{% for tip in tips %}
## Guideline {{ loop.index }}
- **Content:** {{ tip.content }}
- **Rationale:** {{ tip.rationale }}
- **Category:** {{ tip.category }}
- **Trigger:** {{ tip.trigger }}

{% endfor %}

# Your Task
Combine the above guidelines into a smaller set of HIGH-QUALITY, CONSOLIDATED, NON-REDUNDANT guidelines. Merge overlapping advice, remove duplicates, and preserve any unique insights.

**Things to Remember:**
1. Each consolidated guideline should be self-contained, clear and actionable
2. Preserve important nuances from different source guidelines. Preserve specific technical details (API names, parameter names, etc.)
3. Use the most specific and helpful phrasing
4. Remove guidelines that are too generic or obvious.
5. Reduce the total count while retaining all valuable information

{% if not constrained_decoding_supported %}
**Output Format (JSON):**
```json
{
    "tips": [
        {
            "content": "Clear, actionable tip",
            "rationale": "Why this tip helps",
            "category": "strategy|recovery|optimization",
            "trigger": "When to apply this tip"
        }
    ]
}
```

Generate consolidated guidelines now. Return ONLY the JSON, no other text.
